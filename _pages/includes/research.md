### *Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection*
**2023.01 - 2023.06**

**Supervisor: Prof. [Yongyong Chen(é™ˆå‹‡å‹‡)](http://faculty.hitsz.edu.cn/chenyongyong)**


- Introduced a novel method for Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection using Multimodal Low-Rank Tensor Representation (MLTR), and improved the accuracy and generalization capabilities of HAD by employing a low-rank representation of multi-modal tensors.
- Outperformed previous methods on ten datasets and achieved a higher AUC, including the SanDiego dataset. Reduced the running time by approximately 20% compared to TLRSR.
- The paper is submitted to IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters.

### *Next-POI Recommendation*
**2022.09 - 2023.04**

**Supervisor: Prof. [Shanshan Feng(å†¯å±±å±±)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/cfar/about-cfar/our-team/feng-shanshan)**


- Thoroughly reviewed all the papers, and successfully replicated the code from groundbreaking studies on Next-POI, published in 2021 and 2022. Gaining a basic understanding of the Next-POI field.
- Actively contributed to research group meetings, presenting relevant articles and sharing my insights, fostering a collaborative learning environment. Engaged in constructive discussions within the research group regarding potential enhancements to these models.
